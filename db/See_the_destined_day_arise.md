Title: See the destined day Arise
version: 1

See the destined day arise!
See a willing sacrifice!
Jesus, to redeem our loss, 
hangs upon the shameful cross;


Jesus, who but You could bear 
wrath so great and justice fair?
Every pang and bitter throe, 
finishing your life of woe?

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
Lamb of God for sinners slain!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
Jesus Christ, we praise your name!

Who but Christ had dared to drain, 
steeped in gall, the cup of pain,
And with tender body bear thorns, 
and nails, and piercing spear?

Slain for us, the water flowed, 
mingled from your side with blood;
Sign to all attesting eyes 
of the finished sacrifice.

Holy Jesus, grant us grace 
in that sacrifice to place
All our trust for life renewed, 
pardoned sin, and promised good.

Grant us grace to sing your praise, 
‘round your throne through endless days,
Ever with the sons of light: 
“Blessing, honor, glory, might!”
