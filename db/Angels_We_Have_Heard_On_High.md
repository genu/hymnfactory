Title: Angels We Have Heard On High
---
Angels we have heard on high,
sweetly singing oâ€™er the plains
and the mountains in reply,
echoing their joyous strains. 

Refrain:
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
which inspire your heavenly song?

Come to Bethlehem and see
him whose birth the angels sing;
come, adore on bended knee 
Christ the Lord, the new-born King.
